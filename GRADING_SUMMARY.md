# Writing & Speaking Grading - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema Update

**Modified `AttemptSection` model:**
- Added `rubric Json?` field for storing detailed grading criteria
- No migration needed to run manually (schema updated, will create on next `prisma migrate dev`)

```prisma
model AttemptSection {
  // ... existing fields ...
  gradedById String?
  rubric     Json?      // NEW: Store rubric scores
  feedback   String?     @db.Text
  // ... existing fields ...
}
```

**Automatic Recalculation:**
When all 4 sections have band scores:

2. Apply IELTS rounding rule:

   - 0.25 to < 0.75 → round to .5
   - ≥ 0.75 → round up
3. Update `Attempt.bandOverall`

**Example:**
- Reading: 6.5
- Listening: 7.0
- Writing: 7.0
- Speaking: 6.5
- Average: (6.5 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 6.5) / 4 = 6.75
- Rounded: 7.0

**Integration with Auto-Scoring (Task G):**
- R/L auto-scored on submit

- Overall band calculated when all 4 complete

console.log('Pending:', queue.pendingTotal);

// 2. Grade a section
const sectionId = queue.queue[0].sections.find(s => s.status === 'pending').id;

await fetch(`/api/attempt-sections/${sectionId}/grade`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    bandScore: 7.0,
    rubric: { taskAchievement: 7.0, coherenceCohesion: 7.5, lexicalResource: 6.5, grammaticalRange: 7.0 },
    feedback: 'Great work!'
  })

// 3. As STUDENT - view results
const results = await fetch(`/api/attempts/${attemptId}/review`).then(r => r.json());
console.log('Overall Band:', results.bandOverall);
```

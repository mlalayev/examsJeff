# Teacher Analytics - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement

**Added `QuestionTag` Model:**
```prisma
model QuestionTag {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  questionId String
  question   Question @relation(fields: [questionId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  tag        String
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
  
  @@index([tag])
  @@index([questionId])
  @@map("question_tags")
}
```

**Updated `Question` Model:**
- Added `tags QuestionTag[]` relation

**Purpose:**
- Enable topic-level analysis
- Group questions by skill/topic (e.g., "True/False/Not Given", "Matching Headings")
- Calculate accuracy per topic to identify weak areas

### 2. Analytics API Endpoint

#### GET `/api/analytics/teacher/overview?classId=xxx`

**Purpose:** Provide comprehensive analytics for a specific class

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "class": {
    "id": "xxx",
    "name": "IELTS Advanced October 2025",
    "teacher": { "id", "name", "email" }
  },
  "studentsCount": 15,
  "attemptsCount": 42,
  "avgOverall": 6.8,
  "avgBySection": {
    "READING": 7.0,
    "LISTENING": 6.9,
    "WRITING": 6.5,
    "SPEAKING": 6.8
  },
  "trendLastN": [
    { "weekStart": "2025-09-23", "avgOverall": 6.5 },
    { "weekStart": "2025-09-30", "avgOverall": 6.7 },
    { "weekStart": "2025-10-07", "avgOverall": 6.8 }
  ],
  "weakTopics": [
    { "tag": "True/False/Not Given", "accuracyPercent": 45.2, "attempts": 120 },
    { "tag": "Matching Headings", "accuracyPercent": 58.3, "attempts": 80 },
    { "tag": "Fill in Blanks", "accuracyPercent": 72.1, "attempts": 95 }
  ]
}
```

**Features:**
- âœ… **Class-scoped:** Only shows data for students in specified class
- âœ… **Authorization:** Verifies teacher owns the class
- âœ… **Averages:** Calculates overall and per-section band averages
- âœ… **Trend Analysis:** Groups attempts by week (last 8 weeks)
- âœ… **Weak Topics:** Analyzes question tags for accuracy patterns
- âœ… **Empty State Handling:** Returns zeros/nulls when no data

**Calculations:**

1. **Average Overall:**
   ```javascript
   avgOverall = sum(bandOverall) / attemptsCount
   ```

2. **Average by Section:**
   ```javascript
   avgBySection[type] = sum(sections[type].bandScore) / count(sections[type])
   ```

3. **Weekly Trend:**
   - Group attempts by week (Monday as week start)
   - Calculate average band per week
   - Return last 8 weeks

4. **Weak Topics:**
   - Match student answers to tagged questions
   - Calculate accuracy = (correct / total) * 100
   - Sort by accuracy (lowest first)
   - Return top 10 weakest

### 3. Analytics UI Page

#### `/dashboard/teacher/analytics/[classId]`

**Layout:**

**Header:**
- Back button â†’ Teacher Dashboard
- Class name display

**KPI Cards (4 cards):**
1. **Students** - Enrolled count
2. **Attempts** - Completed attempts count
3. **Avg Overall** - Average band (color-coded)
4. **Data Points** - Weeks with data

**Performance Trend Chart:**
- SVG line chart
- X-axis: Week start dates
- Y-axis: Band scores (0-9)
- Shows last 8 weeks
- Trend indicator (Improving/Declining)

**Section Performance Bars:**
- 4 sections: READING, LISTENING, WRITING, SPEAKING
- Horizontal progress bars
- Color-coded by band range:
  - 8-9: Green
  - 7-7.5: Blue
  - 6-6.5: Purple
  - 5-5.5: Orange
  - <5: Red

**Weak Topics Table:**
- Topic name
- Accuracy percentage
- Attempts count
- Status badge (Critical/Weak/Good/Strong)
- Sorted by accuracy (weakest first)

**Empty State:**
- Shows when no attempts exist
- Message: "Not enough data"
- Encouragement to have students complete exams

### 4. Navigation Enhancement

**Classes Page (`/dashboard/teacher/classes`):**
- Changed from single "Manage" button to dual buttons:
  1. **Manage** (blue) - Opens roster
  2. **Analytics** (purple) - Opens analytics page
- Side-by-side layout for easy access

## Architecture

```
Teacher clicks "Analytics" on class card
         â†“
Navigate to /analytics/[classId]
         â†“
GET /api/analytics/teacher/overview?classId=xxx
         â†“
1. Verify teacher owns class
2. Get students in class
3. Get all attempts for those students
4. Calculate averages (overall, per-section)
5. Group by week for trend
6. Analyze tagged questions for weak topics
         â†“
Return structured JSON
         â†“
UI renders:
  - KPI cards
  - Trend chart (SVG)
  - Section bars
  - Weak topics table
```

## Database Schema Changes

**Migration: `analytics_tags`**

```sql
-- Create question_tags table
CREATE TABLE "question_tags" (
  "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  "questionId" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "tag" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  
  CONSTRAINT "question_tags_questionId_fkey" 
    FOREIGN KEY ("questionId") REFERENCES "questions"("id") 
    ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX "question_tags_tag_idx" ON "question_tags"("tag");
CREATE INDEX "question_tags_questionId_idx" ON "question_tags"("questionId");

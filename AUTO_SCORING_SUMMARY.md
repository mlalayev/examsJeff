# Auto-Scoring Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

### 1. Scoring Service (`src/lib/scoring.ts`)

**Core Functions:**
- `isAnswerCorrect()` - Compares student answer with answer key, supports multiple question types:
  - Multiple choice (A/B/C/D)
  - True/False/Not Given
  - Fill in blank (accepts array of acceptable answers)
  - Short answer
  - Matching (object comparison)
  - Note completion, summary completion (array comparison)
  
- `scoreSection()` - Scores an entire section:
  - Counts correct answers
  - Calculates raw score (sum of points)
  - Returns detailed breakdown per question
  
- `getBandScore()` - Looks up band from BandMap table:
  - Finds matching examType and section
  - Returns band where rawScore falls in range [minRaw, maxRaw]
  
- `applyIELTSRounding()` - Applies IELTS .25/.75 rounding rule:
  - < .25 â†’ rounds down
  - .25 to < .75 â†’ rounds to .5
  - â‰¥ .75 â†’ rounds up
  
- `calculateOverallBand()` - Averages section bands and rounds
  
- `scoreAttempt()` - Complete workflow:
  - Auto-grades READING and LISTENING
  - Skips WRITING and SPEAKING (manual grading)
  - Calculates overall band from all sections

**Answer Normalization:**
- Case insensitive
- Trims whitespace
- Removes punctuation
- Handles variations (e.g., "temperature" vs "temperatures")

### 2. Updated Submit Endpoint (`src/app/api/attempts/[id]/submit/route.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Imports `scoreAttempt` from scoring service
- After submission, calls `scoreAttempt(attemptId)`
- Returns scoring results in response
- Gracefully handles scoring errors (submission succeeds even if scoring fails)

**Flow:**
1. Validate attempt ownership
2. End all in-progress sections
3. Mark attempt as SUBMITTED
4. Update booking status to COMPLETED
5. **Run auto-scoring** (new!)
6. Return scored attempt with band scores

### 3. Review Endpoint (`src/app/api/attempts/[id]/review/route.ts`)

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/attempts/:id/review`

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "attemptId": "xxx",
  "status": "SUBMITTED",
  "submittedAt": "2025-10-06T10:00:00Z",
  "bandOverall": 6.5,
  "sections": [
    {
      "type": "READING",
      "rawScore": 23,
      "bandScore": 7.0,
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": "q1",
          "order": 1,
          "qtype": "multiple_choice",
          "prompt": { "text": "What is X?" },
          "studentAnswer": "B",
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "points": 1
        },
        {
          "id": "q2",
          "order": 2,
          "studentAnswer": "TRUE",
          "correctAnswer": "NOT GIVEN",
          "isCorrect": false,
          "points": 0
        }
      ],
      "summary": {
        "correctCount": 20,
        "totalQuestions": 23,
        "rawScore": 20,
        "maxRawScore": 23
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "WRITING",
      "graded": false,
      "message": "Pending teacher grading"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Features:**
- Shows detailed breakdown for READING/LISTENING
- Indicates pending grading for WRITING/SPEAKING
- Requires attempt to be SUBMITTED
- Only accessible by attempt owner

## Architecture

```
Student submits attempt
         â†“
POST /api/attempts/:id/submit
         â†“
1. Mark sections as COMPLETED
2. Mark attempt as SUBMITTED
3. Update booking to COMPLETED
4. Call scoreAttempt()
         â†“
scoreAttempt() for each section:
    - If READING/LISTENING:
        a. Get questions for section
        b. Compare student answers to answer keys
        c. Calculate raw score
        d. Look up band score from BandMap
        e. Update AttemptSection (rawScore, bandScore)
    - If WRITING/SPEAKING:
        - Skip (manual grading)
         â†“
5. Calculate overall band (average + IELTS rounding)
6. Update Attempt (bandOverall)
         â†“
Return scored attempt
```

## Database Changes

**No migrations needed!** Uses existing schema:
- `AttemptSection.rawScore` - Stores number of correct answers
- `AttemptSection.bandScore` - Stores converted band (e.g., 7.0)
- `Attempt.bandOverall` - Stores overall band after rounding
- `BandMap` table - Stores conversion tables (examType, section, minRaw, maxRaw, band)

## API Changes

### Modified:
- **POST /api/attempts/:id/submit**
  - Now includes auto-scoring
  - Returns `scoring` object with results
  - Response: `{ message, attempt, scoring: { overallBand, sectionBands } }`

### New:
- **GET /api/attempts/:id/review**
  - Returns detailed review with correct/wrong answers
  - Shows question-by-question breakdown
  - Only for SUBMITTED attempts
  - Only accessible by attempt owner

## Testing

See `TESTING_AUTO_SCORING.md` for complete testing guide.

**Quick Test:**
```javascript
// 1. Import band mappings (one time)
// See examples/band-map-import-example.json

// 2. Create and complete attempt
const { attempt } = await fetch('/api/attempts', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ bookingId: 'xxx' })
}).then(r => r.json());

// 3. Submit (triggers auto-scoring)
const result = await fetch(`/api/attempts/${attempt.id}/submit`, {
  method: 'POST'
}).then(r => r.json());

console.log('Overall Band:', result.attempt.bandOverall);

// 4. Get review
const review = await fetch(`/api/attempts/${attempt.id}/review`)
  .then(r => r.json());

console.log('Review:', review);
```

## Verification Checklist

Run these checks:

- [ ] Raw score 23 for IELTS Reading â†’ Band 7.0
- [ ] Raw score 15 for IELTS Reading â†’ Band 6.0
- [ ] Raw score 30 for IELTS Listening â†’ Band 8.0

âœ… **Answer Matching:**
- [ ] 'B' matches 'b' (case insensitive)
- [ ] 'NOT GIVEN' matches 'not given'
- [ ] 'temperature' matches 'temperatures' (if in acceptable answers)
- [ ] Wrong answer marked as incorrect

âœ… **IELTS Rounding:**
- [ ] (6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.0) / 4 = 6.375 â†’ 6.5
- [ ] (7.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 6.5) / 4 = 6.875 â†’ 7.0
- [ ] (6.0 + 6.0 + 6.0 + 6.0) / 4 = 6.0 â†’ 6.0

âœ… **Review Accuracy:**
- [ ] Shows all questions
- [ ] Marks correct answers as correct
- [ ] Marks wrong answers as wrong

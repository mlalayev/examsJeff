# Text Formatting Guide

The exam system now supports custom text formatting in question prompts and answer options. This allows you to emphasize important text, add visual clarity, and improve the overall presentation of your questions.

## Supported Formatting

### 1. Bold Text
Use double asterisks (`**`) to make text bold:
```
**This text will be bold**
```
**Result:** **This text will be bold**

### 2. Underline Text
Use double underscores (`__`) to underline text:
```
__This text will be underlined__
```
**Result:** <u>This text will be underlined</u>

### 3. Strikethrough Text
Use double tildes (`~~`) to add strikethrough:
```
~~This text will have a line through it~~
```
**Result:** ~~This text will have a line through it~~

### 4. Italic Text
Use em dashes (`—`) to make text italic:
```
—This text will be italic—
```
**Result:** *This text will be italic*

> **Note:** To type the em dash (—), use:
> - Windows: `Alt + 0151`
> - Mac: `Option + Shift + -`
> - Or copy and paste: —

## Combining Formats

You can combine multiple formatting styles to create more complex text effects:

```
__**Bold and underlined text**__
```
**Result:** <u>**Bold and underlined text**</u>

```
**~~Bold with strikethrough~~**
```
**Result:** **~~Bold with strikethrough~~**

```
—**Bold italic text**—
```
**Result:** *__Bold italic text__*

## Where Can I Use Formatting?

Text formatting is supported in:
- ✅ Question prompts (main question text)
- ✅ Answer options (MCQ choices, inline select options, etc.)
- ✅ Gap fill options
- ✅ Transcripts

## Live Preview

When creating or editing questions, you'll see a live preview of how the formatted text will appear:

1. Type your text with formatting markers in the input field
2. The preview appears below the input
3. Click "Text formatting guide" to see examples and syntax

## Examples

### Example 1: Emphasizing Keywords
```
Which word is **NOT** a preposition: on, under, quickly, or between?
```

### Example 2: Grammar Question
```
Choose the ~~incorrect~~ word: __She go__ to school every day.
```

### Example 3: Multiple Choice with Formatting
Question: "What is the capital of France?"
- Option A: `**Paris**`
- Option B: `London`
- Option C: `Berlin`
- Option D: `Madrid`

### Example 4: Combined Formatting
```
The word —quickly— is an adverb, **not** an adjective. It __modifies__ verbs.
```

## Tips

1. **Keep it simple**: Don't over-format. Too much formatting can be distracting.
2. **Be consistent**: Use the same formatting patterns throughout your exam.
3. **Test it**: Always check the preview to ensure the formatting looks correct.
4. **Accessibility**: Remember that formatting should enhance, not replace, clear question writing.

## Technical Notes

- Formatting is processed in real-time as you type
- The formatted text is displayed to students exactly as shown in the preview
- All formatting is preserved when exporting or importing questions
- HTML select dropdowns (for inline select questions) cannot display nested formatting, so the raw text is shown

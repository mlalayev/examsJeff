They love school work and their teacher, but they never listen! Sometimes, they do their homework together. Usually, Sammy-Jo goes to Chelsea’s house because Chelsea has no brothers or sisters. Sammy-Jo has two sisters and a brother.\nWhen they are not together, they talk on their phones and message each other. On Saturdays, they usually go into town together. If it rains, they take the bus. In the morning, they look at the shops and do a bit of shopping. In the afternoon, sometimes they go to the cinema or just chill in the park.\nThey see each other on Sundays too. Sometimes, they watch a film together in Chelsea’s bedroom or play computer games. They dress the same: both like jeans and T-shirts. They even swap clothes sometimes. Pizza is their favorite dish. They have one difference: Chelsea loves dogs, but Sammy-Jo loves cats.",

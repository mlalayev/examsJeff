I visited so many famous places, like the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, and the British Museum. The weather was a bit cold, but I didn’t mind because there was so much to see and do. I also went on a boat tour along the River Thames. The view of the city from the river was beautiful. I took lots of pictures that I can’t wait to show you. The food in London was great too! I tried fish and chips, which is a popular dish there. It was delicious! One of the best parts of my trip was going to see a musical in the West End. The show was incredible, and the actors were so talented. I really enjoyed it. I bought a few souvenirs for you, and I can’t wait to give them to you when we meet. Let’s catch up soon! Take care, Kelly.",

- **Average Band:** `AVG(bandOverall) WHERE studentId = X AND bandOverall NOT NULL`

### Teacher Overview
- **Classes:** `COUNT WHERE teacherId = X`
- **Students:** `COUNT ClassStudent WHERE class.teacherId = X`
- **Pending Grading:** `COUNT AttemptSection WHERE type IN (W,S) AND bandScore = NULL AND booking.teacherId = X`
- **Bookings:** `WHERE teacherId = X AND startAt >= NOW() ORDER BY startAt ASC LIMIT 10`
- **Pending Sections:** `WHERE type IN (W,S) AND bandScore = NULL AND booking.teacherId = X LIMIT 5`
